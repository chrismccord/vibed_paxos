# Paxos Consensus Algorithm Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a complete Paxos consensus algorithm in Elixir with Phoenix LiveView dashboard visualization.

## Progress Checklist
- [x] Generate Phoenix project called `paxos_consensus`
- [x] Create detailed plan and start server
- [x] Replace home page with modern dark dashboard mockup
- [x] Implement core Paxos data structures and types
- [x] Create Paxos.Proposer module (Phase 1: Prepare/Promise)
- [x] Create Paxos.Acceptor module (Phase 2: Accept/Accepted) 
- [x] Create Paxos.Learner module (learns consensus results)
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - ✅ Single proposer basic consensus
  - ✅ Multiple proposer conflict resolution
  - ✅ Network partition simulation
  - ✅ Failure recovery scenarios
  - ✅ **NEW**: Extensive edge case testing (22 tests total)
    - ✅ Concurrent proposal handling with Paxos safety
    - ✅ Proposer crash and recovery scenarios
    - ✅ Large cluster testing (7 nodes)
    - ✅ High concurrency stress testing
    - ✅ Message ordering and timing issues
    - ✅ Network partition and minority scenarios
- [x] Create real-time LiveView dashboard with interactive controls
- [x] Update router with dashboard route
- [x] Style layouts to match our dark dashboard theme
- [x] Visit running app to verify dashboard loads correctly
- [x] **TESTING COMPLETE**: All 22 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Test full end-to-end consensus workflow via dashboard
- [ ] Final demonstration

## Technical Implementation Notes
- ✅ Pure Elixir message passing (no external deps)
- ✅ GenServer-based node architecture with proper Paxos safety properties
- ✅ Phoenix PubSub for real-time dashboard updates
- ✅ **Comprehensive test coverage**: 22 tests covering all distributed scenarios
- ✅ Modern dark dashboard design for visualization
- ✅ Interactive controls for node management and consensus proposal
- ✅ **Proper Paxos implementation**: Proposers correctly adopt previously accepted values

## Test Results Summary
**✅ ALL 22 TESTS PASSING**
- Basic consensus scenarios: 3 tests
- Edge cases and failure modes: 10 tests  
- Recovery and concurrent scenarios: 4 tests
- State management: 2 tests
- Web controller: 3 tests

**Key Edge Cases Tested:**
- Network partitions preventing consensus without majority
- Acceptor failures during consensus rounds
- Proposer crash and recovery with higher proposal numbers
- Rapid successive proposals from same proposer
- Very large clusters (7 nodes) with network delays
- Conflicting proposals with prior accepted values
- Message ordering and out-of-order delivery
- High concurrency stress testing (3 proposers, 9 concurrent proposals)
