# Paxos Consensus Algorithm Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a complete Paxos consensus algorithm in Elixir with Phoenix LiveView dashboard visualization.

## Progress Checklist
- [x] Generate Phoenix project called `paxos_consensus`
- [x] Create detailed plan and start server
- [ ] Replace home page with modern dark dashboard mockup
- [ ] Implement core Paxos data structures and types
- [ ] Create Paxos.Proposer module (Phase 1: Prepare/Promise)
- [ ] Create Paxos.Acceptor module (Phase 2: Accept/Accepted) 
- [ ] Create Paxos.Learner module (learns consensus results)
- [ ] Add Paxos.Cluster module for coordinating multiple nodes
- [ ] Implement PaxosConsensus.Node GenServer for node lifecycle
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - Single proposer basic consensus
  - Multiple proposer conflict resolution
  - Network partition simulation
  - Failure recovery scenarios
- [ ] Build Phoenix LiveView dashboard with real-time visualization:
  - Current consensus rounds
  - Node states and roles
  - Message flow between nodes
  - Historical consensus results
- [ ] Update router with dashboard route
- [ ] Style dashboard with modern dark theme
- [ ] Visit running app to verify Paxos implementation works
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Pure Elixir message passing (no external deps)
- GenServer-based node architecture
- Phoenix PubSub for real-time dashboard updates
- Comprehensive test coverage for distributed scenarios
- Modern dark dashboard design for visualization
