# Paxos Consensus Algorithm Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a complete Paxos consensus algorithm in Elixir with Phoenix LiveView dashboard visualization.

## Progress Checklist
- [x] Generate Phoenix project called `paxos_consensus`
- [x] Create detailed plan and start server
- [x] Replace home page with modern dark dashboard mockup
- [x] Implement core Paxos data structures and types
- [x] Create Paxos.Proposer module (Phase 1: Prepare/Promise)
- [x] Create Paxos.Acceptor module (Phase 2: Accept/Accepted) 
- [x] Create Paxos.Learner module (learns consensus results)
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - ✅ Single proposer basic consensus
  - ✅ Multiple proposer conflict resolution
  - ✅ Network partition simulation
  - ✅ Failure recovery scenarios
- [x] Create real-time LiveView dashboard with interactive controls
- [x] Update router with dashboard route
- [x] Style layouts to match our dark dashboard theme
- [x] Visit running app to verify dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] **CURRENT ISSUE**: Node creation in dashboard needs debugging
- [ ] Test full end-to-end consensus workflow via dashboard
- [ ] Final demonstration

## Technical Implementation Notes
- ✅ Pure Elixir message passing (no external deps)
- ✅ GenServer-based node architecture
- ✅ Phoenix PubSub for real-time dashboard updates
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for distributed scenarios
- ✅ Modern dark dashboard design for visualization
- ✅ Interactive controls for node management and consensus proposal
- ❌ **BUG**: Dashboard form submission not actually starting Paxos nodes

## Test Results
All 9 tests passing, but dashboard integration needs final debugging.
