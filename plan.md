# Paxos Consensus Algorithm Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a complete Paxos consensus algorithm in Elixir with Phoenix LiveView dashboard visualization.

## Progress Checklist
- [x] Generate Phoenix project called `paxos_consensus`
- [x] Create detailed plan and start server
- [x] Replace home page with modern dark dashboard mockup
- [x] Implement core Paxos data structures and types
- [x] Create Paxos.Proposer module (Phase 1: Prepare/Promise)
- [x] Create Paxos.Acceptor module (Phase 2: Accept/Accepted) 
- [x] Create Paxos.Learner module (learns consensus results)
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite:
  - ✅ Single proposer basic consensus
  - ✅ Multiple proposer conflict resolution
  - ✅ Network partition simulation
  - ✅ Failure recovery scenarios
- [ ] Update router with dashboard route
- [ ] Style layouts to match our dark dashboard theme
- [ ] Visit running app to verify everything works
- [ ] Final testing and demonstration

## Technical Implementation Notes
- ✅ Pure Elixir message passing (no external deps)
- ✅ GenServer-based node architecture
- ✅ Phoenix PubSub for real-time dashboard updates
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for distributed scenarios
- ✅ Modern dark dashboard design for visualization

## Test Results
All 9 tests passing including:
- Basic single proposer consensus
- Multiple proposer conflict resolution
- Majority acceptor requirements
- State management verification
